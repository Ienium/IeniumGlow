# Glow 2D Renderer

This will be a modern C++ 2D rendering library designed for games

## ✨ Planned Features

- **Batched Rendering** - Optimized draw calls for maximum performance
- **Layer System** - Easy depth sorting and composition  
- **Texture Management** - Built-in texture atlasing and optimization
- **Sprite Rendering** - Sprites
- **Shape Rendering** - Rectangles, circles, lines, and custom shapes
- **Text Rendering** - Text
- **Modern OpenGL** - Leverages OpenGL 3.3+ for optimal performance
- **Clean API** - Simple, intuitive interface that gets out of your way


## 🏗️ Planned Architecture

Glow is built with a modular architecture:

- **Glow-Core** - Math, memory management, and utilities
- **Glow** - 2D rendering engine with multiple specialized renderers
- **Clean separation** between public API and internal implementation

## 📄 Documentation
See [Documentation for the Pipeline and Memory Management](docs/memory_and_pipeline.md) for more details
